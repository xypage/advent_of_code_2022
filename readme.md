# Advent of Code 2022
This is my repo for doing [Advent of Code](https://adventofcode.com/2022) this year. I've done some of the puzzles from other years but I only found out about it after last years so I've never done it as it happened before, so I'm tracking my progress here to stay accountable. I'll be doing it in rust, a language I've been learning off and on between classes for a while now, I really enjoy working with iterators in it and I feel it's well suited to the challenges.

## Updated system 12/05
I wanted to make a more cohesive system for running the code so I did, the module logic within a single binary makes a lot more sense to me after figuring that out. The gist of it is that you use `cargo run $day $part` to run the part for a specific day, and you can say `cargo run $day $part test` (or really any 5th argument I don't actually check the value, just the arg count) then it'll run the test for that part instead. I'm not including my input because it's irrelevant for the project, but I have an top level input folder with files named dayNN and dayNN-test, where the top line of dayNN-test is expected_part1_out---expected_part2_out that way I can test both parts with the one input file.
