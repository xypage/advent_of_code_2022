# Advent of Code 2022
This is my repo for doing [Advent of Code](https://adventofcode.com/2022) this year. I've done some of the puzzles from other years but I only found out about it after last years so I've never done it as it happened before, so I'm tracking my progress here to stay accountable. I'll be doing it in rust, a language I've been learning off and on between classes for a while now, I really enjoy working with iterators in it and I feel it's well suited to the challenges.
